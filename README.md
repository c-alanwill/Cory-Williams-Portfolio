## Description

* The HTML code contains a logical structure for the elements within the page.  There are sections for the header, hero image and body.

* Notes were applied to the HTML code to identify each section of code for the header, hero image and section within the body.

* Alt attributes were added for each image in the HTML text to provide a description if for some reason the user cannot view the image due to a slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

* The CSS selectors and properities were ordered to match the semantic structure of the HTML elements. 

* Media queries were added to the CSS so that the site would be responsive and adapt to all sizes of devices.

* The css uses flexbox, media quaries and CSS variables.
